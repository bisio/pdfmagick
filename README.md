# pdfmagick
pdftk python wrapper for manipulating pdf files

## Motivation
pdfmagick is modeled after needs of my projects:

One of my project needs pdf templates < 1.5 or with old style xref table
so here a tool to sniff the structure of pdf xref table and convert to old one.

Cutting out pages from multi page pdfs is also a frequent need.
